# Tryptamine
Tryptamine is an dynamically typed interpreted programming language. I have attempted to make Tryptamine as freestanding as possible, everything that can be written in it, is. <br>
<br>
## Getting Started
To start, clone this repo using git and cd into it. <br>
At this point make sure you have g++ or any compiler for c++. <br>
`tryp.cpp` and `axon.cpp` are just routing files, these mean you can just run <br>
`tryp` followed by your file to run, instead of invoking python each time. <br>
